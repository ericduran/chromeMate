This project is build on top of Skywriter (Mozilla Bespin).

My final goal is to have a full fledge editor that's usable on Chrome OS with or without internet service.

***IMPORTANT***
Right now the extension only supports editing one file, but has mockup of a file drawer and tab interface.
This is a work in progress. Most of the functionality is in code, such as saving, and retrieving files I just having put a UI on it, 
so It's not possible of save a new file, unless you call the js command directly :-(.

This is only on github because I needed some place to host my code while I work.

Hopefully this will be a full fledge editor soon.
